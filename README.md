1) Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program-
In October 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for subsection (d) hospitals that rank in the worst-performing quartile with respect to hospital-acquired conditions (HACs). Hospitals with a Total HAC Score above the 75th percentile of the Total HAC Score distribution may be subject to the payment reduction. This table contains hospitals’ measure and Total HAC scores, as well as a payment reduction indicator. The Total HAC Score is calculated using the individual measure scores.

2) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program-
In October 2012, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, calculated by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients.

3) Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) – Clinical Outcomes Domain Scores-
A list of hospitals participating in the Hospital VBP Program and their performance rates and scores for the Clinical Outcomes measures.
